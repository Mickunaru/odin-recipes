    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Glutinous rice - 2 cups</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Pork (ground) - 8 oz</li>
        <li>Mung beans - 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Dried mushrooms - 2-3 pieces</li>
        <li>Shallot - 2, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Banana leaves - 4-6, for wrapping</li>
        <li>String, for tying</li>
        <li>Dipping sauce, for serving</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Soak the glutinous rice in water for at least 2 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li> Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water for 20-30 minutes, or until softened. Remove the stems and finely chop the caps.</li>
        <li> In a pan, cook the ground pork until browned. Add the mushrooms, mung beans, shallots, turmeric powder, salt and pepper. Cook until the mung beans are tender. Let the mixture cool down.</li>
        <li> Drain the glutinous rice and grind it in a food processor or a mortar and pestle to a fine consistency.</li>
        <li> Lay out a banana leaf on a work surface, with the smooth side facing up and the shiny side facing down. Place about 1/4 cup of the rice mixture in the center of the leaf and use your fingers to press and shape it into a small cylinder (about 4-5 inches in length and 2 inches in diameter) . Make a small well in the center of the cylinder and fill it with about 2 tablespoons of the pork filling. Cover the filling with more rice mixture and shape it into a cylinder again. Repeat the process with the remaining leaves, rice and filling.</li>
        <li>Wrap the cylinder tightly with the banana leaf, folding the edges to enclose the cylinder completely. Tie each end of the cylinder with a piece of string. You can make more or fewer ties, depending on the size of the leaf and the cylinder. </li>
        <li>In a large pot, bring enough water to a boil and gently place the cylinders into the water. Bring the water to a simmer and cook for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. The banana leaves should be a dark green color and the rice should be fully cooked. </li>
        <li>Remove the banh tet from the pot and let them cool down. Carefully unwrap the banana leaves and cut the cakes into thick slices. Serve with dipping sauce and herbs. </li>
