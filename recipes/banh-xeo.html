    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Banh Xeo, also known as "sizzling pancake," is a legendary delicacy from Vietnam, renowned for its crispy golden exterior and delectable filling. This savory treat is a true celebration of the flavors and textures of Vietnam's rich culinary heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
        The batter for the pancake is made from a blend of rice flour, turmeric, and coconut milk, which is then filled with a tantalizing mixture of pork, shrimp, mung beans and bean sprouts. This concoction is then cooked to perfection in a hot skillet, creating a crispy exterior that gives way to a steamy, flavorful interior.

    <p>
        The art of cooking banh xeo is passed down from generation to generation, and the secret to a perfect banh xeo lies in the delicate balance of ingredients. The pork should be cooked just right, adding a lovely contrast in texture and taste to the pancakes. The shrimp should be plump and succulent, adding a hint of sweetness to the dish. The bean sprouts, mung beans and herbs gives a crunchy and fragrant touch.

    <p>
        Traditionally, banh xeo is enjoyed wrapped in lettuce leaves with herbs and dipped in a savory nuoc cham sauce. The combination of the warm and crispy pancakes, with the cool and refreshing herbs and dipping sauce creates an explosion of flavors in your mouth.

        Banh Xeo is more than just a meal, it's a cultural experience. Each bite of the sizzling pancake, each sip of the nuoc cham sauce is a journey through the rich culinary history of Vietnam. And that's what makes Banh Xeo truly legendary.

        <li>Coconut milk - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Pork (diced) - 8 oz</li>
        <li>Bean sprouts - 1 cup</li>
        <li>Mung beans - 1/4 cup</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>   
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together rice flour, turmeric powder, and coconut milk in a bowl. Let the mixture sit for 30 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the liquid.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or pan over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil. Once the oil is hot, add the diced pork and cook until it's browned and cooked through, about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the bean sprouts and mung beans to the skillet and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of the batter into the skillet and tilt the skillet to distribute the batter evenly. Cook the pancake for 2-3 minutes or until the edges start to turn golden brown and crispy. Flip the pancake and cook for another minute on the other side.</li>
        <li>Fold the banh xeo in half and cut it into wedges.</li>
        <li>Serve the banh xeo hot with lettuce leaves, herbs, and nuoc cham sauce on the side for dipping. Enjoy the banh xeo by wrapping a piece in lettuce leaves, adding some herbs, and dipping it in the sauce before eating.</li>
